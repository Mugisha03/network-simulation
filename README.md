# 🌐 Network Simulations

This repository contains my **Cisco Packet Tracer network simulation labs**, created to demonstrate key networking concepts including routing, switching, firewalls, and network security.

Each lab simulates real-world enterprise scenarios to strengthen practical networking skills and understanding of network infrastructure.

## 🧪 Lab List

### 🧭 Day 01 — Packet Tracer Introduction  
**Scenario:**  
A simulation connecting two branches — **New York** and **Tokyo** — using routers, swithches, computers, servers and the internet.  
Includes LAN configurations, firewalls for security, and an external attacker simulation to test network defenses.

**Key Concepts Covered:**
- Inter-branch routing  
- LAN segmentation  
- Basic firewall rules  
- Internet connectivity and attack simulation  

### 🧭 Day 02 - Connecting Devices to Their Labels
**Scenario:**
A simulation showing how to connect different network devices — such as servers, computers, routers, and switches — using various types of cables.

**Key Concepts Covered:**

- Differences between cable types (Straight-through, Crossover, UTP, Fiber) and their appropriate use.

- Understanding of interfaces and ports on different devices.

- Introduction to Auto-MDIX and its role in simplifying cabling.

- Measuring cable distances and choosing the right medium (copper vs. fiber).

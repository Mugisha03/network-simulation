# 🌐 Network Simulations

This repository contains my **Cisco Packet Tracer network simulation labs**, created to demonstrate key networking concepts including routing, switching, firewalls, and network security.

Each lab simulates real-world enterprise scenarios to strengthen practical networking skills and understanding of network infrastructure.
